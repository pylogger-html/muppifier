Are you tired of reading about the same people everyday? Spice up your news with the Muppifier. Certain names are replaced with other names. Check it out:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Before</th>
    <th>After</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="images/before.png" alt="Before" width="400"></td>
    <td><img src="images/after.png" alt="After" width="400"></td>
  </tr>
</table>

Isn't that better?


## FAQ

### 1. **Why did you do this?**
   I wanted a way to have a break from reading about the same people every day. MAGA Muppifier filters text on your browser and does not alter the original content. You'll get to escape to your own custom alternate reality. Don't dwell too long, or you may not be able to go back...

### 2. **I want to add more names to the list. Can I?**
   Yes, add as many names as you want.
   
### 3. **Does this plugin have spyware? Can you read my screen?**
   The plugin can read your screen but I can't. There is no spyware on here too and the full source is on github. I've never written a chrome plugin or any javascript before, so I'm sure the whole thing is terribly written. Most of it is copy-pasted code from various examples online and AI generated stuff. If you've got a better way to do this, send me a PR. Use simple words in the PR.

### 4. **I'm still seeing these people in images & video, why can't you replace that too?**
   Replacing images and video in real-time is really difficult and probably would involve copyrighted images. I'm not going to go there. Text is simple.

### 5. **Is this legal?**
   This plugin is a parody and is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or officially associated with any companies, products, or individuals referenced. Any resemblance to real names, brands, or entities is purely coincidental and not intended to imply any association. The plugin is created solely for humorous and non-commercial purposes. All content within the plugin is meant to be a satire and does not infringe on any trademarks or intellectual property. I make no money from your usage of this and there is no way to send me any money.

### 6. **Who's side are you on?**
   I have my own US political opinions, but the plugin doesn't. It's got people from both sides
   and you can add more. As many as you want.
